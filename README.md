# Sandy Code
Diana won ERC 2032 and now it's time for Stefano to have a holiday. Fortuna learned how to set up the perfect spot on the beach but... OH NO! Albi and Michele are up to something! What are they doing? OH NO! they want to ruin Stefano's holidays! They're playing by throwing sandballs to each other and some of them have landed on Fortuna's code! Now the code it's a complete mess. Can you help Stefano recover the code?

Luckly, always Stefano bring with him a file he uses as a test, that we provide in the `TestFile.cpp` . He knows that if all the tests are passed without errors, the code is almost correct. What you have to do is to find and fix all the bugs in the `bugFixing.hpp`. There could be syntax errors, logical errors or maybe sandy errors. Notice that having the correct output is not enough! Some errors can still be missed so be very careful. 

Once you've done it, you have to provide as a `BUGS.txt`  file that contains the bugs you have found (specify line number and a brief description of the problem) and provide the correct version of the `bugFixing.hpp`
