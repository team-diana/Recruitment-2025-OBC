# Sandy Code
Diana won ERC 2032 and now it's time for Stefano to have a holiday. Fortuna has learned how to set up the perfect spot on the beach: it uses the drone to find a free spot, then the arm grabs the umbrella and the chair and... OH NO! Albi and Michele are up to something! What are they doing? OH NO! Michele threw a sandball to Albi and now Albi is very angry. Look at Michele! He moved very close to Stefano. If Albi now throws a sandball to Michele there is the risk that… OH NO! The sandball landed on Fortuna’s code and now the code is a complete mess! Harry up! Help Albi recover the code before Stefano notices it!

Luckily, Stefano always brings with him a file he uses for testing. He knows that if the program reaches the end, the code is almost correct. Can you help Albi to recover the code? 

## Instruction
What you have to do is to find and fix all the bugs in the `bugFixing.hpp`, make sure it compiles and then use the `TestFile.cpp` to test your work. There could be syntax errors, logical errors or maybe some sand grains moved something to the wrong place. Notice that having the correct output is not enough! Some errors could still be missed so be very careful. Please do not modify anything in the TestFile.cpp, Stefano had worked on it for a long time and he might get very angry if someone modifies that, as much as if someone ruins his holidays.

Once you've done it, you have to provide as a `BUGS.txt` file that contains the bugs you have found (specify line number and a brief description of the problem) and provide the correct version of the `bugFixing.hpp`
